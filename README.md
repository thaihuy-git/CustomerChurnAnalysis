## Goal
This project aims to utilise advanced data analytics to identify patterns of current customer attrition and understand the factors driving their decisions. This will then support strategy development to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce customer turnover.

## Scope
Use the provided dataset to examine customer attrition behaviour inside a telecom company. The emphasis will be on identifying major trends, patterns, and causes linked with customer churn using descriptive and exploratory data analysis. The data will assist the company in learning which types of consumers are more likely to depart, which services they used, and what factors contributed to their churn. By segmenting customers and analyzing churn categories and reasons, this initiative aims to inform strategic decisions that can enhance customer retention and satisfaction. Answer the following questions:
- How many customers are in different statuses: joined, churned, and total customers?
- What is the overall churn rate?
- How does the churn rate vary across customer demographics?
- Which cities or regions have the highest customer churn?
- How do different contract types relate to churn behavior?
- What is the churn rate in combination of phone service and internet service?
- How do monthly charges differ between churned and retained customers across contract types?
- What are the most common churn reasons, and how frequently do they occur?
- What is the churn rate by internet type?
- Are specific service subscriptions (in the internet service) associated with higher or lower churn rates?
- What is the relationship between tenure and churn? Do long-term customers churn less?
- How do the payment method and billing preference influence churn?
- Is there a correlation between Tenure and Monthly Charge with churned customers?
